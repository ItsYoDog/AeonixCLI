This operating system includes code written by:

- Codexahedron (https://github.com/Codexahedron)

  The original base code for this operating system was written by Codexahedron. Several modules, including the multiboot and keyboard modules, were adapted from the code provided by Codexahedron.

- Erich Boleyn 

	The base code and license for the GNU GRUB bootloader. Several modules including (partially) the keyboard, screen and module core modules, were made by the GNU Project.

- PixelWare Studuos

  A large portion of this operating system was written by PixelWare Studios. They have customized, extended, and built upon the original code to create a unique operating system.

Thank you to Codexahedron and PixelWare Studios for sharing their code and making this project possible!
